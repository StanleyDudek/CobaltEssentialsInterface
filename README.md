## Pre-requisites:

1. BeamMP Server 3.4.1 (or newer)
2. [CobaltEssentials](https://github.com/prestonelam2003/CobaltEssentials) 1.7.6 or newer installed.
3. As you are the owner, have yourself set as owner group in CobaltEssentials (i.e. `ce setgroup yourName owner` in server console)

## Installation:

1. Grab the latest release from [releases](https://github.com/StanleyDudek/CobaltEssentialsInterface/releases).
2. Unpack it somewhere.
3. Drag the folder `Resources` into the directory where your server is installed.
4. Start the server, and join.
5. The interface should be enabled by default. In the chat, enter the command /CEI to toggle the interface. You may set the default interface state in the Cobalt Essentials section of the interface's Config tab.

## Updating:

1. Grab the latest release from [releases](https://github.com/StanleyDudek/CobaltEssentialsInterface/releases).
2. Unpack it somewhere.
3. Drag the folder `Resources` into the directory where your server is installed, accept the overwrites.
4. If you have server console errors after updating delete just about everything in the CobaltDB folder aside from playerPermissions.json
